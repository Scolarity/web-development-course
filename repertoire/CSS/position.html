    <h1>Position CSS</h1>
    <p>If the position is static it is how it would normally be in plain HTML:</p>
    <div id="static"></div>
    <p>
        If the position is relative it is static, but it doesn't affect other elements and it can be positioned by using left, right, top, bottom expressions in css. <br> 
        They add margins left, right, ect. respective to their static position. It does leave a "ghost" element behind where the static relative position was.
    </p>
    <p>Relative with <em>'left: 20px;'</em></p>
    <div id="relative"></div>
    <p>Relative with <em>'top: 20px;'</em> that overlaps other elements:</p>
    <div id="relativeOverlap"></div>
    <div id="green"></div>

    <h3>Exercise with relative position:</h3>
    <div id="redRelative"></div>
    <div id="blueRelative"></div>
    <div id="yellowRelative"></div>
    <p>
        If the position is absolute it is relative but it is relative to its parent element. This does not leave a ghost element behind, so it can affect other elements, just not how you expect.
    </p>
    <p>
        A fixed position is like an absolute position but it is always relative to the screen, so it stays where it is on the screen even if you scroll down <br>
        This can be useful when you are create a navigation bar for example.
