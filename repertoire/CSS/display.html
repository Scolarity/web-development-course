    <h1>Display</h1>
    <p>A paragraph is by default a block display element, so nothing else can go on that same line, you can customize the width and height though with block elements</p>
    <p>A span is an inline element, you cannot change the height or width but it only takes up the space it needs</p>
    <p>You can use spans to <span class="select">select</span> a piece of the text and change it with css, that's the main use of spans</p>
    <p>like <span class="select">underlining</span> a piece of text</p>
