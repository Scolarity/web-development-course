    <h2>For sans-serif and serif you need to look at w3school, serif has more texture and added things from sans-serif, sans-serif is simpler</h2>
    <img src="serif.gif" alt="serif and sans-serif">
    <h2><span style="font-family: cursive;">Cursive</span> and <span style="font-family: fantasy;">Fantasy</span> are two font families that you almost never use because they are difficult to read.</h2>
    <h2>You could use <span style="font-family: monospace;">monospace</span> for code editors</h2>

    <h2>For most browsers, the default font in the font-family serif, is arial, but verdana, for example is also a good one.</h2>
    <h2>You can specify the font in the font-family already, just have it be in front of the family name: <span style="font-family: monospace;">'font-family: verdana, sans-serif;'</span>.</h2>
    <h2>If the browser doesn't support that font type though, it will show their sans-serif default.</h2>
    <h2>To combat this, there are web safe font, that are supported by most web browsers.</h2>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_websafe.asp#:~:text=The%20following%20list%20are%20the%20best%20web%20safe,Garamond%20%28serif%29%208%20Courier%20New%20%28monospace%29%20Altri%20elementi">W3schools CSS Web Safe Fonts Page</a>
    <h2>No font is 100% compatible though, if you look at this website for example: <a href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/">cssfontstack</a>, and then you would need fallbacks written after the first font: <span style="font-family: monospace;">'font-family: verdana, Arial (the fallback), sans-serif;'</span>.</h2>
 	<h2>You can find new fonts at the google fonts page, and you can find a link tag there, add that to your css file with import [link] or at the head of a page.</h2>
    <h2>Then you can just put them in your font-family line in your code with the appropriate name of the font</h2>
	<h2>If you get it from there everyone will see it if they have an internet connection, they don't need their browser to support it.</h2>
